# Receipt Program (Dart)

A simple receipt generator application built with **Dart**.  
This was one of my first projects while learning to code, before moving on to Java.  
The program allows users to input purchased items, quantities, and prices, then automatically calculates subtotals, discounts, and the final total.

## Features
- Input multiple items with name, quantity, and price

  - > 1000 → 20%
